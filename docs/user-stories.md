# User Stories

**Project:** UnioLoci  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 12th, 2025

## Introduction

This document contains the **user stories** derived from the functional requirements defined in [`docs/srs.md`](docs/srs.md) and the MVP scope in [`docs/vision_scope.md`](docs/vision_scope.md). The stories follow the standard agile format: **"As [user type], I want [action] so that [benefit]"**. Each story includes acceptance criteria based on non-functional requirements and success criteria.

These stories cover only the MVP. For future expansions (e.g., additional views, roles), additional stories will be created in later ADRs.

Suggested prioritization: High for core functionalities (authentication, calendars, events, real-time sync); medium for AI and notifications.

## Final Notes

- **Estimation**: Each story can be estimated in story points during planning (e.g., 1-5 points based on complexity).
- **Testing**: Use acceptance criteria to write acceptance tests (e.g., with Cucumber or manual).
- **References**: Refer to [`docs/api-design.md`](docs/api-design.md) for technical details and [`docs/database-schema.md`](docs/database-schema.md) for data schemas.
