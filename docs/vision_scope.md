# Vision & Scope

**Version:** 1.2  
**Date:** December 12th, 2025  
**Author:** Josué Cruz

# 1. Name: **UnioLoci**

The name blends two Latin roots: **Unio** (“union”) and **Loci** (“places”). Together they represent **“A unified space”**—a single shared environment where group scheduling and collaborative organization converge.

# 2. Purpose

1. **Provide a unified cooperative calendar**, where groups work from a single real-time schedule instead of fragmented, individually owned calendars.
2. **Serve as a didactic portfolio project** to practice architecture, real-time collaboration, and artificial intelligence using **NestJS**, **React**, and **Flutter**.

# 3. Product Vision

To become **“the shared document of scheduling.”**

UnioLoci reframes calendars as a **collaborative document**—not a collection of personal calendars layered on top of each other. Every member sees and edits the **exact same calendar**, removing friction, confusion, and permission complexity. All changes occur in real time.

# 4. Problem Statement

## 4.1 The Problem

Existing calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.) are built for individuals. Collaboration is an afterthought and introduces issues:

- **Ownership ambiguity:** Events belong to individual accounts, not groups.
- **Complex permissions:** Editing requires fragile, multi-step configuration.
- **Lack of synchronization:** Adding or removing group members requires event-by-event updates.
- **Multiple conflicting sources of truth:** Personal calendars overlap, creating confusion.

## 4.2 The Solution

**UnioLoci** treats the calendar as a **single shared entity** owned collectively by the group.

- Everyone can edit everything.
- All updates occur in real time.
- New members instantly see the full calendar with no setup.

It becomes the **one source of truth**.

# 5. Project Scope (MVP)

The MVP focuses on delivering a minimal but solid, fast, and collaborative shared calendar that demonstrates architectural clarity, real-time syncing, and AI-assisted actions.

## 5.2 Out of Scope (MVP)

- Additional calendar views (Week, Day).
- Roles or permissions (everyone can edit everything).
- Private events.
- External integrations (Google, Outlook, .ics).
- Guests invitation system.
- Public display screens.
- Chat or comments.
- Advanced AI (documents/images → events, group availability suggestions, conflict detection).

# 6. Success Criteria (MVP)

The MVP is successful if:

1. A group of **3 users** can manage their weekly schedule exclusively with UnioLoci.
2. Event changes appear for other users within **3 seconds**.
3. The system maintains **full editability for all members** without confusion.
4. A user can join a calendar via link with zero friction.
5. AI can reliably convert natural text into a valid event.
6. AI automatically generates a helpful description for new events.
7. Navigation and editing remain smooth with a calendar containing **50+ events**.

# 7. Technical Overview

- **Backend:** NestJS (REST or GraphQL) + WebSockets
- **Frontend:** React (with Zustand or TanStack Query)
- **Real-Time:** WebSockets with minimal sync strategy
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API for text-to-event and description generation (using TOON for structured output)
